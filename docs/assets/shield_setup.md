## Shield Logo Setup Instructions

To complete the setup of the shield logo:

1. Save the shield image attachment as: `shield_logo.png`
2. Place it in the directory: `assets/images/`
3. The full path should be: `c:\RS_Flutter\rs_flutter\assets\images\shield_logo.png`

The app will automatically use the image once it's placed in the correct location. If the image is not found, it will fallback to the custom-built shield icon.
